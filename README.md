# Dartcounter
Repository for my dart counter written in Pascal. Created a new repository, because the old one was a mess.
What the program does:

 - Keeps score and determines who is the winner
 - Checks if inserted value is allowed or not
 - Different game modes (301,501,701,1001)
 - Best of 1,3,5,9 or endless matches
 - Currently Dutch language only
